Memory Manager
==============

This project is based on Operating System 

You (the user) simulate the scheduler and input the data to be 
stored in memory for the next process, both interactively, and randomly or from a file.

The program should assign each process to a memory block or put it on a 
waiting queue if there is no room available in memory. Also you should display 
(either as text or graphically) the contents of memory and the waiting queue as 
changes are made. You should include a menu to provide these options. Input 
should continue until you decide to terminate.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. First Fit
2. Best Fit
3. Worst Fit

### Extra Implementations
Compaction - either when the waiting 
queue exceeds a certain value or after a certain interval of time, or when the user 
chooses to compact memory 

### TODO
Draw all components including:
* Memory Container
* Algorithms drop down menu
* Input for PID (Process ID#)
* Input for Process Size
